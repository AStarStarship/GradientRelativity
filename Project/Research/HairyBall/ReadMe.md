# Hairy Ball Theorem

This file contains research on the Hairy Ball Theorem as it pretains to Gradient Relativity. Our claim is that plank springs have magnetic field lines that are a hairy ball and there is always a spot on the ball where the force is 0, and this dictates the direction of the movement of the EM wave propagation.
