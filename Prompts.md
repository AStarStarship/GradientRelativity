## Step 1: Content Table

I am authoring a quantum physics thesis research paper for Theory of Gradient Relativity in the `./Paper/RoughDraft.md` file. I need you to split `./Paper/RoughDraft.md` into multiple markdown files based on the Content table in the `./Paper/ReadMe.md` file.

## Step 2: Abstract

I am authoring the "Abstract" secion of my quantum physics thesis research paper for Theory of Gradient Relativity in the `./Paper/RoughDraft.md` file. This theory is based on the idea that electrons are condensed space that get into atoms when electrons are excited into higher energy states, which condenses "plank springs" into one area, making the electron oscilate at a higher frequency. The theory says that the strong nuclear force doesn't exist, but the condensed space is smaller, which explains quantum tunneling better than the strong force. Please read `./Paper/RoughDraft.md` and write your version fo the Abstract into `./Paper/Abstract/ReadMe.md`.

## Step 3: Summary

I am authoring the "Summary" secion of my quantum physics thesis research paper for Theory of Gradient Relativity. This theory is based on the idea that electrons are condensed space that get into atoms when electrons are excited into higher energy states, which condenses "plank springs" into one area, making the electron oscilate at a higher frequency. The theory says that the strong nuclear force doesn't exist, but the condensed space is smaller, which explains quantum tunneling better than the strong force. The summary must contain the Hairy Ball Theory explaination for how EM waves radiate outwards. Please read `./Paper/RoughDraft.md` and write your version fo the Abstract into `./Paper/Summary/ReadMe.md`.

## Step 4: PyTorch Source Initialization

Please read the `./Paper/RoughDraft.md` and write a Python quantum physics simulation to calculate the amount of space stored in electrons based upon the energy differnce in emited RF frequency radiation when electrons go from a higher energy state to a lower energy state. Place the source code in `./Source`.
