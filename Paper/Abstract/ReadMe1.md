# Abstract

This thesis introduces *Gradient Relativity*, a novel framework for understanding quantum phenomena through the concept of condensed space. We propose that electrons are not point particles but manifestations of condensed spacetime that coalesce when electrons transition to higher energy states. This condensation compresses fundamental “Planck springs” into localized regions, causing the electron to oscillate at increased frequencies.

In this model, the traditional strong nuclear force emerges not as a distinct interaction but as a consequence of spatial compression at the quantum scale. The reduced volume of condensed space naturally explains quantum tunneling without invoking an ad hoc strong force, providing a more parsimonious description of subatomic interactions.

Gradient Relativity unifies several quantum behaviors—such as quantization, tunneling, and entanglement—under a single geometric principle. By treating condensed space as the substrate of particle dynamics, the theory offers testable predictions and a fresh perspective on the underlying geometry of quantum fields.

The implications of this framework extend to diverse areas, including material science, quantum computing, and the study of high‑energy particle collisions. Future work will focus on deriving the precise mathematical formulation of condensed space dynamics and exploring experimental validations.
