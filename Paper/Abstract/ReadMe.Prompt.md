I am authoring the "Abstract" secion of my quantum physics thesis research paper for Theory of Gradient Relativity in the `./Paper/RoughDraft.md` file. This theory is based on the idea that electrons are condensed space that get into atoms when electrons are excited into higher energy states, which condenses "plank springs" into one area, making the electron oscilate at a higher frequency. The theory says that the strong nuclear force doesn't exist, but the condensed space is smaller, which explains quantum tunneling better than the strong force. Please read `./Paper/RoughDraft.md` and write your version fo the Abstract into `./Paper/Abstract/ReadMe.md`.
