Abstract

This paper proposes 'Gradient Relativity', a framework describing quantum phenomena through the condensation of space into matter. We posit that electrons are not fundamental particles but manifestations of condensed space, or quanum foam, that get into atoms when electrons are excited into higher energy states, putting more "plank springs" into one ares and causing higher‑frequency oscillations. In this model the strong nuclear force is unnecessary; instead, the spatial compression of Planck‑size units accounts for observed nuclear binding and quantum tunneling. Gravitational interactions emerge from the gradient in the Planck‑constant field, with equilibrium at unity corresponding to the cosmic expansion rate. By scaling the speed of light to one, the theory unifies aspects of special relativity and quantum mechanics, reproducing time‑dilation and energy‑momentum relations as geometric consequences of the gradient. The model predicts that electromagnetic waves arise from the oscillation of condensed space between electric and magnetic phases, and that dark matter corresponds to regions where electrons reside at gravitational equilibrium without emitting radiation. Additional implications include a mechanistic explanation for black‑hole interiors, Hawking radiation limits, and the origin of cosmic expansion. While the approach offers a novel perspective on fundamental interactions, it requires further development and empirical validation.
