Abstract: This work introduces Gradient Relativity, a framework positing that electrons represent condensed spacetime that undergoes structural transitions when excited to higher energy states. In this model, what is conventionally described as the strong nuclear force emerges from spatial compression, enabling more accurate descriptions of quantum tunneling. Electromagnetic radiation is explained through the oscillation of Planck-scale “springs” governed by sine and cosine functions, with wave propagation directed by the Hairy Ball Theorem, which dictates a zero‑vector point on each spherical mode and defines the direction of EM wave radiation. By scaling the speed of light to unity and mapping its dynamics onto General Relativistic time‑dilation equations, the theory unifies gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena within a single geometric formalism. The resulting model predicts quantized energy exchange, natural explanations for black‑hole thermodynamics, and a novel origin for cosmic expansion, while adhering to conservation laws.
